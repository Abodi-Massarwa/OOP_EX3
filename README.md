About the project 
In this project we built a directed graph which is also a weighted graph in Python 
Also in this project you will find some algorithms that can be done on a graph that is both directed and weighted.
We use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes and DFS algorithms to find the SSC 
We encountered some problem in the task that hindered us in the last hours from submitting the assignment and we had to deal with them.
we had to use Dictionary. we used to store data values in key: value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates. (key , Nodedata)
Init: short for initialization to Initialize the graph
get graph: return dictionary (key , Nodedata)
save to json: return true if save else return 
load from json: return true if the graph loaded else false 
shortest path: return the shortest path between source to dest
connected component: to find the strongly connected component (SCC) that this node is part of.
# More information about the graph and the algorithms 
# Weighted Graph
A weighted graph is a graph in which each branch is given a numerical weight. A weighted graph is therefore a special type of labeled graph in which the labels are numbers (which are usually taken to be positive).
# Directed graph
A directed graph is graph, a set of objects that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed network. In contrast, a graph where the edges are bidirectional is called an undirected graph.
# Dijkstra's algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm)[4] is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph,
Let the node at which we are starting be called the initial node. Let the distance of node Y be the distance from the initial node to Y. Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step.
# Depth-first search
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
